To serve the front-end, I decided to use React to handle state and components, and Webpack to package it.

						issues = "This application was a complex project with many moving parts. The largest issue I encountered involved security of the application and user data. I relied heavily on industry standards to ensure my application and any data transferred was secure and was received by the correct user. I learned how JSON web tokens functioned, and how they are used to provide a secure connection method to the API."

Although Google Sheets was not built for this type of application, it was useful since my data could be accessed on multiple devices. Other applications suited to solve this problem had the same issue in common: they were not customizable and lacked the analytical features useful in tracking my progress. My application resolved these issues and improved the features found in other applications. I implemented a complete, secure, RESTful API in this application and used MongoDB Atlas to store user information in the cloud allowing my information to be accessed everywhere. My app has a unique frontend interface for complete control over my data."

Fairness was an issue I had to solve, and I decided the most fair way to distribute requests was a first-come-first-serve method. All incoming user requests were sent to a database accessed by my automated script at discrete time intervals."

Particularly in the time of COVID 19, this app was extensively used due to the high demand for outdoor activities. I built a backend system in Express.js to facilitate requests and automate tasks.
