Although Google Sheets was not built for this type of application, it was useful since my data could be accessed on multiple devices. Other applications suited to solve this problem had the same issue in common: they were not customizable and lacked the analytical features useful in tracking my progress. My application resolved these issues and improved the features found in other applications. I implemented a complete, secure, RESTful API in this application and used MongoDB Atlas to store user information in the cloud allowing my information to be accessed everywhere. My app has a unique frontend interface for complete control over my data."

Particularly in the time of COVID 19, this app was extensively used due to the high demand for outdoor activities. I built a backend system in Express.js to facilitate requests and automate tasks. This was connected to a React frontend to allow users to input data."
